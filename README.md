## Quick start

To run this application you'll need a webserver with PHP enabled. The simplest
way is to use the php embedded dev server. To do so start with a console in the
projects root folder and cd into the 'src/' directory. Then start the embedded
php dev server:

$ cd src/
$ php -S localhost:8080

Then fire up a browser (No, i don't count IE as a browser) and navigate to
"http://localhost:8080/" and you'll see the front-end of the application.

You can host the application with an apache too. All you need to know to do
that is that the 'src/' directory is the web root.
